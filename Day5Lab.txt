Lab 5. Coding assignment

5.1 Create a class Point2D ,    : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

5.2 Create a parameterized constructor to init x & y co-ords.

5.3 Add a method to return string form of  point's x & y co-ords
Hint :  public String toString()) 
5.4 Add isEqual method to Point2D class :a boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.
eg : public boolean isEqual(Point2D anotherPoint)
{
 .......
}
eg : p1.isEqual(p2)


5.5 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point and specified point & return the distance to the caller.
Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.
eg : public double calculateDistance(Point2D anotherPoint)
{
  Math.sqrt(.....);
}


5.6 Write TestPoint class    with a main method
Accept co ordinates of 2 points from user (Scanner) --to create 2 points (p1 & p2)

5.7 Use getDetails method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

5.8 Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same position)

5.9 Display distance between p1 & p2
